======================

This is a very simple password store that encrypts passwords using gpg and
places the encrypted password in a directory. It can generate new passwords
and keep track of old ones.

Please see the man page for documentation and examples.

============================

A new option has been added to the `generate` subcommand, allowing the use of a legacy password generation method. By default, `generate` employs a "semi-hash" technique to create passwords from `pass-name`. This technique extracts the first 25 characters (by default) from the base64 encoding of an AES-256 encryption of `pass-name`, using a key stored in `~/.password-store/.key`. This method enables password regeneration even if pass is inaccessible.
